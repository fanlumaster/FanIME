# Prove ISCC can resolve the Chinese language file, by compiling a script that needs it.
#
# install-inno-language.ps1 used to write the file next to the Chocolatey ISCC shim rather than into
# the Inno Setup installation, report success, and let packaging fail several steps later with an
# include error naming a path nothing had written to. Eight releases went out as unpublished drafts
# before anybody connected the two.
#
# Asserting the file exists where install-inno-language.ps1 put it would only restate that script's
# own belief about where ISCC looks, which is precisely the thing that was wrong. Compiling a script
# whose only content is a [Languages] entry pointing at compiler:Languages\ChineseSimplified.isl is
# what makes ISCC answer the question. Seconds on an image that already ships Inno Setup.
